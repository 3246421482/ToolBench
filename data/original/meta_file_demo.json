Interconnected, interrelated or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.[6]. Supply chain management strives for an integrated, multidisciplinary, multimethod approach.[7] Marketing channels play an important role in supply-chain management.[8] Current[when?] research in supply-chain management is concerned with topics related to sustainability, volatility,[9] and risk management,[10] among others. An important concept discussed in SCM is supply chain resilience. Some suggest that the \u201cpeople dimension\u201d of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda.[11] SCM is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product's flow from materials to production to distribution in the most economical way possible.\""

It also extends to the use of corpora and concordancers, interactive whiteboards,[3] computer-mediated communication (CMC),[4] language learning in virtual worlds, and mobile-assisted language learning (MALL).[5]. The term CALI (computer-assisted language instruction) was in use before CALL, reflecting its origins as a subset of the general term CAI (computer-assisted instruction). CALI fell out of favour among language teachers, however, as it appeared to imply a teacher-centred approach (instructional), whereas language teachers are more inclined to prefer a student-centred approach, focusing on learning rather than instruction.\""

Children demonstrate annoyance responses to noise, and noise is also related to lower well-being and stress responses, such as increased levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Noise does not cause more serious mental health problems, but there is growing evidence for an association with increased hyperactivity symptoms. Studies also suggest that noise might cause changes in cardiovascular functioning, and there is \""

In this issue, we launch our Series on Cancer Therapy, exploring current paradigms and recent advances and challenges in this field, through specially commissioned articles.The earliest evidence of cancer treatment can be traced back to an ancient Egyptian medical text, written around 3000 BC and known widely as the \u2018Edwin Smith Papyrus\u2019, that described the cauterization of breast tumors for which, according to the text, there was no cure. The situation is very different now, as, depending on breast cancer subtype, stage and demographic factors, the 5-year survival rates for this disease can surpass 90% in developed countries. For cancer types that are responsive to therapy, including certain subtypes of breast, blood and prostate malignancies, patients now face the management of a chronic disease, rather than a fatal one, owing to the rapid advances\""

We capitalise on the unique restrictions during COVID-19 to understand how time of day of daylight exposure and outside exercise interact with chronotype and sleep quality. 3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18-91) completed our online \u2018SleepQuest\u2019 Study between 29th April and 13th May 2020 \u2013 a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety and attitudes to sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures. Significantly more people (n=1252) reported worsened than improved sleep (n=562) during lockdown (p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with worsened sleep included low mood (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and suspected, proven or at risk of COVID-19 symptoms (all p<0.03). Sleep improvement was related to the increased length of time spent outside (P<0.01). Older people\u2019s sleep quality was less affected than younger people by COVID lockdown (p<0.001). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later, in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in \u2018owl\u2019 (p=0.0002) and not \u2018lark\u2019 (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas, the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside)\""

The clock endows the host with temporal precision and robust adaptation to the surrounding environment. When circadian rhythms are perturbed or misaligned, as a result of jet lag, shiftwork or other lifestyle factors, adverse health consequences arise, and the risks of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases or metabolic disorders increase. Although the negative impact of circadian rhythm disruption is now well established, it remains underappreciated how to take advantage of biological timing, or correct it, for health benefits. In this Review, we provide an updated account of the circadian system and highlight several key disease areas with altered circadian signalling. We discuss environmental and lifestyle modifications of circadian rhythm and clock-based therapeutic strategies, including chronotherapy, in which dosing time is deliberately optimi\""

Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, it produces no direct waste, and almost always emits considerably less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel-powered energy plants.[4] However, when constructed in lowland rainforest areas, where part of the forest is inundated, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases may be emitted.[5]. Construction of a hydroelectric complex can have significant environmental impact, principally in loss of arable land and population displacement.[6][7] They also disrupt the natural ecology of the river involved, affecting habitats and ecosystems, and siltation and erosion patterns.\""

Elsewhere, we have analysed the protocol and argued it basically ethical. Main points for debates: We raise three ethical points. First, the new therapy should demonstrate greater therapeutic effects when compared with other treatment methods. Second, cost is a potential barrier to widespread adoption. Third, the shortage of eye donors in Japan raises ethical concerns of fairness, as Japan relies on donors in other countries Conclusion: While there are many issues to be debated and addressed for this new eye therapy, we believe the ophthalmology field will assume moral leadership in the pursuit of iPSC clinical research. Background On December 26, 2018, the review committee of Osaka University, Japan, granted conditional approval for a clinical trial to transplant corneal cell sheets from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in patients with corneal epithelial stem cell deficiency [1]. We previously objected to the protocol in a separate iPSC transplantation study for heart failure patients as ethically impermissible [2]. However, the protocol in the latest corneal trials appears to meet ethical standards very well. It appears to be fully reliable in its handling of adverse events (rejection or tumorigenicity), as transplanted corneal sheets can be easily removed. Since the new study is already underway, an ethical discussion is even more critical. Main points for debates Below, we raise three points for debate for this up and coming therapy. First, the potential benefits of the study seem to warrant the risk to which research subjects are exposed. The question of whether iPSC sheet grafts can truly surpass allogeneic donated eye transplants or amniotic membranes in quality and therapeutic effects warrants rigorous scientific assessment. The subjects in this transplant study are patients with corneal epithelial stem cell deficiency. Some ophthalmology specialists note that in other cornea diseases, endothelial dysfunction is particularly salient. iPSC sheets replace mainly the epithelium. On the other hand, amniotic membrane demonstrates a record of effectiveness within certain parameters. Demonstrating greater therapeutic effects will be key to adding another future option to cornea transplant methods. *Correspondence to: Akira Akabayashi, Department of Biomedical Ethics, School of Public Health, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan, E-Mail: akirasan-tky@umin.ac.jp\"},{\"Title\":\"Long-term safety and tolerability of subretinal transplantation of embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium in Asian Stargardt disease patients\",\"Abstract\":\"Background Although human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been considered a potential therapeutic option for regenerative medicine, there are some concerns regarding tumorigenicity, immunogenicity and ethical considerations. Stargardt macular dystrophy (SMD) is the most common form of juvenile macular degeneration that causes early onset blindness. Therapeutic options for SMD remain limited, although several treatment strategies are currently under investigation. Here, we report a 3-year assessment of a phase I clinical trial involving subretinal transplantation of hESC-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in patients with SMD. Methods This prospective, non-randomised clinical trial included three patients with SMD. All transplant recipients had central visual acuity no better than 20/400. Trans-pars plana vitrectomy was performed in the eye with poorer vision. RPE cells were reconstituted in balanced salt solution plus, then injected into the subretinal space using a semi-automated subretinal injection method.

Isolating the inner cell mass (embryoblast) using immunosurgery results in destruction of the blastocyst, a process which raises ethical issues, including whether or not embryos at the pre-implantation stage have the same moral considerations as embryos in the post-implantation stage of development.[3][4]. Researchers are currently focusing heavily on the therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells, with clinical use being the goal for many laboratories.[2] Potential uses include the treatment of diabetes and heart disease.[2] The cells are being studied to be used as clinical therapies, models of genetic disorders, and cellular/DNA repair. However, adverse effects in the research and clinical processes such as tumors and unwanted immune responses have also been reported.[5].

Social media refers broadly to web and mobile platforms that allow individuals to connect with others within a virtual network (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or LinkedIn), where they can share, co-create, or exchange various forms of digital content, including information, messages, photos, or videos (Ahmed et al. 2019). Studies have reported that individuals living with a range of mental disorders, including depression, psychotic disorders, or other severe mental illnesses, use social media platforms at comparable rates as the general population, with use ranging from about 70% among middle-age and older individuals to upwards of 97% among younger individuals (Aschbrenner et al. 2018b; Birnbaum et al. 2017b; Brunette et al. 2019; Naslund et al. 2016). Other exploratory studies have found that many of these individuals with mental illness appear to turn to social media to share their personal experiences, seek information about their mental health and treatment options, and give and receive support from others facing similar mental health challenges (Bucci et al. 2019; Naslund et al. 2016b).Across the USA and globally, very few people living with mental illness have access to adequate me\""

Four classes of CRISPR\u2013Cas-derived genome editing agents\u2014nucleases, base editors, transposases/recombinases and prime editors\u2014are currently available for modifying genomes in experimental systems. Some of these agents have also moved rapidly into the clinic. Each tool comes with its own capabilities and limitations, and major efforts have broadened their editing capabilities, expanded their targeting scope and improved editing specificity. We analyze key considerations when choosing genome editing agents and identify opportunities for future improvements and applications in basic research and therapeutics.This is a preview of subscription content, access via your institutionOpen Access articles citing this article.Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters\\nOpen Access\\n17 May 2023Genome Biology\\nOpen Access\\n24 April 2023Nature Communications\\nOpen Access\\n24 April 2023Access Nature \""

Renewable energy projects are typically large-scale, but they are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development.[5][6] Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification, which has several benefits: electricity can move heat or objects efficiently, and is clean at the point of consumption.[7][8].

Such price rises would be felt most by vulnerable populations who depend on markets for their food as well as those already depending on humanitarian assistance to maintain their livelihoods and food access.

Today it forms the basis for the most exciting and fastest developing set of tools in biotechnology that give us the ability to edit any gene in any cellular organism or tissue. CRISPR-Cas promises to enable unprecedented advances in everything from health and diagnostics to agriculture and energy.If you are exploring how to harness this technique in your research, this article will help you understand the basics to get you started. This article is the first in a series designed to carry you through your CRISPR journey, please check out our other articles here.The CRISPR gene-editing process is driven by a complex consisting of a bacterially-derived nuclease (e.g. Cas9) and guide RNA (gRNA). The gRNA is a specific RNA sequence designed to recognize and direct the Cas nuclease to the target DNA region. The gRNA is made up of two parts: CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA).The original CRISPR editing systems were driven by two-part gRNA complexes consisting of crRNA and tracrRNA. More recently, a single gRNA (sgRNA) approach, where the crRNA and the tracrRNA are combined into one RNA molecule, has become popular due to its increased ease and simplicity of use. The general schematic of the CRISPR gene-editing system can be \""

Feminism largely arose in response to Western traditions that restricted the rights of women, but feminist thought has global manifestations and variations.In medieval France philosopher Christine de Pisan challenged the social restrictions on women and pushed for women\u2019s education. In 18th-century England Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman became a seminal work of English-language feminist philosophy. Feminism in the United States had a number of prominent activists during the mid- to late-19th century. Notable mainstream activists included Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony. Less mainstream but similarly important views came from Sojourner Truth, a formerly enslaved Black woman, and Emma Goldman, the nation\u2019s leading anarchist during the late 19th century.Intersectionality is a term coined by professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw in 1989 to describe how different social categories interact, sometimes resulting in compounding effects and tensions. Her paper on the subject argued that discrimination specifically against Black women is different from general anti-woman discrimination or anti-Black racism.

It advocates a critique of maledominated language and performs \u201cresistant\u201d readings of literary texts or histories. Based on the premise that social systems are patriarchal\u2014organized to privilege men\u2014it seeks to trace how such power relations in society are reflected, supported, or questioned by literary texts and expression.One of the founders of this kind of approach was Virginia Woolf, who showed in her 1929 essay A Room of One\u2019s Own how women\u2019s material and intellectual deprivation were obstacles to authorship. Woolf illustrated her case with the abortive artistic aspirations of Shakespeare\u2019s fictitious sister Judith. In another essay, \u201cProfessions for Women,\u201d Woolf also announced the necessity for women writers to kill the \u201cangel in the house,\u201d taking her cue from Coventry Patmore\u2019s mid-Victorian poem of the same name that glorified a domestic (or domesticated) femininity devoid of any critical spirit.Another important source of inspiration has been Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s 1949 The Second Sex. Here de Beauvoir wrote that \u201cone is not born a woman, one becomes one.\u201d De Beauvoir\u2019s point behind her muchquoted comment was that \u201c \u2018woman\u2019 is a cultural construction, rather than a biological one.\u201d As Ruth Robbins notes, this remark is important because it highlights the fact that \u201cthe ideas abo\""

The authors review the traditional economic theories that many are accustomed to when interpreting financial matters (i.e., rational behavior) and compares this to the various studies and articles found in literature.

Is personality genetic, or does the environment play a greater role in shaping who were are?Both genetics and environment play a part in the development of personality, although the specific degree to which each one plays a part often depends on the specific personality trait in question.This article discusses how personality traits are defined, whether personality is genetic, and how traits can sometimes change over time.Traits are typically defined as the different characteristics that make up an individual's personality. Personality traits are relatively stable patterns of thoughts, feelings, and actions that distinguish people as individuals.Trait theory\u00a0suggests that our personalities are made up of a number of different broad traits. For example, extroversion (often known as\u00a0extraversion) is a personality dimension that describes how people interact with the world. Some people are very \""

It is distinguished from humanitarian aid by aiming at a sustained improvement in the conditions in a developing country, rather than short-term relief.

Aid may be bilateral: given from one country directly to another; or it may be multilateral: given by the donor country to an international organisation such as the World Bank or the United Nations Agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, UNAIDS, etc.) which then distributes it among the developing countries.

Lesions to this region of the brain in humans result in difficulty or inability to attend to events that are contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere. Those with lesions to the posterior parietal lobe have little to no difficulty shifting attention to and from stimuli appearing in the space ipsilateral to the lesioned hemisphere.

As a result, these plants need a backup power source such as large-scale storage (not currently available at grid-scale)\u2014or they can be paired with a reliable baseload power like nuclear energy.A typical nuclear reactor produces 1 gigawatt (GW) of electricity. That doesn\u2019t mean you can simply replace it with a 1 gigawatt coal or renewable plant.Based on\""

The primary driver was an almost 7% growth in electricity generation from renewable sources. Long-term contracts, priority access to the grid, and continuous installation of new plants underpinned renewables growth despite lower electricity demand, supply chain challenges, and construction delays in many parts of the world. Accordingly, the share of renewables in global electricity generation jumped to 29% in 2020, up from 27% in 2019. Bioenergy use in industry grew 3%, but was largely offset by a decline in biofuels as lower oil demand also reduced the use of blended biofuels.Renewable electricity generation in 2021 is set to expand by more than 8% to reach 8\u00a0300 TWh, the fastest year-on-year growth since the 1970s. Solar PV and wind are set to contribute two-thirds of renewables growth. China alone should account for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity in 2021, followed by the United States, the European Union and India.Wind is set for the largest increase in renewable generation, growing by 275 TWh, or almost 17%, which is significantly greater than 2020 levels.

Sometimes they are quickly refused the chance to indulge in social events since they suffer difficulty in learning, reading, understanding, etc. AAC seems to be a vital communication aid for dyslexia students by providing an augmented reality (AR) paradigm to effective learning. This paper enhances the existing learning assistance technologies with innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to reinvigorate the Augmentative Alternative Communication (A2C) model for dyslexia children. The AI-based Augmentative Alternative Communication Approach has been developed to enhance learning skills with dyslexia by adapting to practices, and learning models are cognitively considered. The work on the academic skills of dyslexia students has been improved through the AI-based alternative communication paradigm for the improvement of the students with reading and learning. The AI-based AAC (AI\u2013A2C) integrates the hybrid AI classifier in AAC to classify unique questions and provide users with the most appropriate pictograms. In contrast to the standard application, the proposed classifier decreased the effort and time taken to interact by 36.56% and 66.34%.

First, it was found that visual platforms (e.g. Instagram) were more dysfunctional for body image than more textual platforms (e.g. Facebook). Second, taking and editing (but not posting) selfies resulted in negative effects on body image. Positive comments intensified the effects of exposure to idealized content. Third, of the forms of potentially positive content examined in recent research (i.e. fitspiration, disclaimer labels, and body positivity), only body positivity content had a positive effect on body image.

Development of relevant indicators is challenged, however, by the lack of knowledge regarding the relations among socio-economic factors and youth MH. Thirty diverse young people from a Canadian metropolitan area were engaged within a process of social praxis to explore their experiences of the inter-relationship between their socio-economic environments and their MH and their processes of seeking to realize their MH. Participants emphasized 'needs' as foundational to MH, whereas 'wants', driven by materialistic and wealth-oriented values and social norms, constrained their MH. Their reflections on the inter-relations among their MH and socio-economic processes highlight eight inter-related MH needs within the Canadian socio-economic context. In this paper, we present these needs and show how these needs, young people's affective states, and their access to resources within co-evolving socio-economic processes (to enable their needs) illustrate the fundamental inter-relation between young people's MH and socio-economic processes. We identify implications for measuring youth MH within MHP practice, including the importance of iterative indicator frameworks that include measures of young people's access to resources to enable their MH needs and their degree of distress.\"},{\"Title\":\"AFFIRM Online: Utilising an Affirmative Cognitive\u2013Behavioural Digital Intervention to Improve Mental Health, Access, and Engagement among LGBTQA+ Youth and Young Adults\",\"Abstract\":\"Digital mental health interventions may enable access to care for LGBTQA+ youth and young adults that face significant threats to their wellbeing.

Similar is the case for BHEL, which was into the manufacture of steam generators and turbines initially, but has recently taken up manufacturing of Solar panels. NHPC mandate was to set hydropower stations, and they also have taken up the setting up of Solar based power plants.As Government has limited financial resources, it has come out with a novel idea of private investments. Why then are private agencies interested in implementing such systems with their own finances? The logic is that Government would purchase the power generated by private agencies on a long term basis, also known as Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).Typically, PPA is entered into between agency and Government for 25 years. While working out power tariffs, this period is taken into account. As of date, Solar PV power plant components have become cheaper while tariff has come down as low as Rs 2 per unit.

Davidson,[17][18] and Sam Harris.. Clinical psychology and psychiatry since the 1970s have developed a number of therapeutic applications based on mindfulness for helping people experiencing a variety of psychological conditions.[18] Mindfulness practice has been employed to reduce depression,[19][20][21][22] stress,[20][23][24] anxiety,[19][20][25] and in the treatment of drug addiction.[26][27][28] Programs based on mindfulness models have been adopted within schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans' centers, and other environments, and mindfulness programs have been applied for additional outcomes such as for healthy aging, weight management, athletic performance,[29] helping children with special needs, and as an intervention during the perinatal period.. Clinical studies have documented both physical- and mental-health benefits of mindfulness in different patient categories as well as in healthy adults and children.[3][30][31] Studies have shown a positive relationship between trait mindfulness (which can be cultivated through the practice of mindfulness-based interventions) and psychological health.[32][33] The practice of mindfulness appears to provide therapeutic benefits to people with psychiatric disorders,[34][35][36] including moderate benefits to those with psychosis.[37][38][39] Studies also indicate that rumination and worry contribute to a variety of mental disorders,[40][41][42] and that mindfulness-based interventions can enhance trait mindfulness[43] and reduce both rumination and worry.[42][44][45] Further, the practice of mindfulness may be a preventive strategy to halt the development of mental-health problems.[46][47]  However, according to one opinion article, too much mindfulness may produce negative effects.[48]. Evidence suggests that engaging in mindfulness meditation may influence physical health.[49] For example, the psychological habit of repeatedly dwelling on stressful thoughts appears to intensify the physiological effects of the stressor (as a result of the continual activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis) with the potential to lead to physical health related clinical manifestations.[50][51][52] Studies indicate that mindfulness meditation, which brings about reductions in rumination, may alter these biological clinical pathways.[50][42][53] Further, research indicates that mindfulness may favorably influence the immune system[54] as well as inflammation,[3][55][56] which can consequently impact physical health, especially considering that inflammation has been linked to the development of several chronic health conditions.[57][58] Other studies support these findings.[59][60][53] Additionally, mindfulness appears to bring about lowered activity of the default mode network of the brain, and thereby contribute towards a lowered risk of developing conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease.[50].\""

Countries such as China, USA and India have already made huge investments on installing renewable energy infrastructure. Hence, many of these countries are in need of investigating the effects of their investments on the countries\u2019 economic growth, carbon footprint and the well-being of their environment. This study provides a comprehensive discussion on how renewable energy usage can contribute towards the economic enhancements mainly to the Gross Domestic Production (DGP). A conceptual model were established to understand the effects of the development of renewable energy establishments on some key economic performance indicative parameters such as the household consumption, government consumption, capital formation, trade balance and energy import and then eventually on the GDP formation. Then, the data collected from an emerging economy were analysed incorporating a path analysis by using SPSS Amos software. Chi square (\u03c7 2 ) test and maximum likelihood indices are used to assess the overall fit of the model. Overall, the findings of this study clearly show that the promotion of renewable energy establishments can cause a significant reduction in energy related imports while increasing the GDP of a nation. Accordingly, it is apparent that Sri Lanka has aligned their economic strategies in terms of becoming a 100% sustainable energy driven nation by 2050 as their major economic indicators are positively correlated with the promotion of renewable energy establishments.\"},{\"Title\":\"Virtual Inertia Control Application to Enhance Frequency Stability of Interconnected Power Systems with High Renewable Energy Penetration\",\"Abstract\":\"Due to a rapid increase in the utilization of power converter-based renewable energy sources (RESs), the overall system inertia in an interconnected power system might be significantly reduced, increasing the vulnerability of the interconnected power system to the system instability. To overcome problems caused by the significant reduction in system inertia, this paper proposes a new application of virtual inertia control to improve frequency stability of the interconnected power system due to high penetration level of RESs. The derivative control technique is introduced for higher-level applications of virtual inertia emulation. Thus, the proposed virtual inertia control loop has a second-order characteristic, which provides a simultaneous enabling of damping and inertia emulations into the interconnected power system, enhancing frequency stability and resiliency. System modeling and simulation results are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink\u00ae (R2016b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Trajectory sensitivities are also performed to analyze the dynamic effects of virtual inertia control\u2019s parameters on the system stability. The effectiveness of the virtual inertia control concept on stability improvement is verified through a multi-area test system with high RESs penetration level for different contingencies.\"},{\"Title\":\"Analysis of the global wood\u2010chip trade's response to renewable energy policies using a spatial price equilibrium model\",\"Abstract\":\"Wood chip, mainly used to produce paper and other products traditionally, has also been used to produce biofuel. The global demand for wood chip is increasing as policies promote the use of biomass for renewable energy. The USA has been a major exporter of wood chip worldwide, but US exports of wood chip could decline if this resource is increasingly used for domestic electricity generation and cellulosic biofuel production. Meanwhile, European Union (EU) demand for wood chip is expected to increase rap"

The cumulative effect of the Stockholm, Rio, and Johannesburg conferences identified sustainable energy development (SED) as a very important factor in the sustainable global development. This study reviews energy transition strategies and proposes a roadmap for sustainable energy transition for sustainable electricity generation and supply in line with commitments of the Paris Agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above the preindustrial level. The sustainable transition strategies typically consist of three major technological changes namely, energy savings on the demand side, generation efficiency at production level and fossil fuel substitution by various renewable energy sources and low carbon nuclear. For the transition remain technically and economically feasible and beneficial, policy initiatives are necessary to steer the global electricity transition towards a sustainable energy and electricity system.

Evaluating public perception on the importance of ethical design principles of artificial intelligence\",\"Abstract\":\"Despite the immense societal importance of ethically designing artificial intelligence, little research on the public perceptions of ethical artificial intelligence principles exists. This becomes even more striking when considering that ethical artificial intelligence development has the aim to be human-centric and of benefit for the whole society. In this study, we investigate how ethical principles (explainability, fairness, security, accountability, accuracy, privacy, and machine autonomy) are weighted in comparison to each other. This is especially important, since simultaneously considering ethical principles is not only costly, but sometimes even impossible, as developers must make specific trade-off decisions. In this paper, we give first answers on the relative importance of ethical principles given a specific use case\u2014the use of artificial intelligence in tax fraud detection. The results of a large conjoint survey ( n = 1099 ) suggest that, by and large, German respondents evaluate the ethical principles as equally important. However, subsequent cluster analysis shows that different preference models for ethically designed systems exist among the German population. These clusters substantially differ not only in the preferred ethical principles but also in the importance levels of the principles themselves. We further describe how these groups are constituted in terms of sociodemographics as well as opinions on artificial intelligence. Societal implications, as well as design challenges, are discussed.\"},{\"Title\":\"Artificial Intelligence and Ethics in Dentistry: A Scoping Review\",\"Abstract\":\"Dentistry increasingly integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve the current state of clinical dental practice. However, this revolutionary technological field raises various complex ethical challenges. The objective of this systematic scoping review is to document the current uses of AI in dentistry and the ethical concerns or challenges they imply. Three health care databases (MEDLINE [PubMed], SciVerse Scopus, and Cochrane Library) and 2 computer science databases (ArXiv, IEEE Xplore) were searched. After identifying 1,553 records, the documents were filtered, and a full-text screening was performed. In total, 178 studies were retained and analyzed by 8 researchers specialized in dentistry, AI, and ethics. The team used Covidence for data extraction and Dedoose for the identification of ethics-related information. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Among the included studies, 130 (73.0%) studies were published after 2016, and 93 (52.2%) were published in journals specialized in computer sciences. The technologies used were neural learning techniques for 75 (42.1%), traditional learning techniques for 76 (42.7%), or a combination of several technologies for 20 (11.2%). Overall, 7 countries contributed to 109 (61.2%) studies. A total of 53 different applications of AI in dentistry were identified, involving most dental specialties. The use of initial data sets for internal validation was reported in 152 (85.4%) studies. Forty-five ethical issues (related to the use AI in dentistry) were reported in 22 (12.4%) studies around 6 principles: prudence (10 times), equity (8), privacy (8), responsibility (6), democratic participation (4), and solidarity (4). The ratio of studies mentioning AI-related ethical issues has remained similar in the past years, showing that there is no increasing interest in the field of dentistry on this topic. This study confirms the growing presence of AI in dentistry and highlights a current lack of information on the ethical challenges surrounding its use. In addition, the scarcity of studies sharing their code could prevent future replications. The authors formulate recommendations to contribute "

Empirical studies found that large US cities exhibit resilience to automation impacts because of the increased occupational and skill specialization. However, in this study, we observe polarized responses in large Chinese cities to automation impacts. The polarization might be attributed to the elaborate master planning of the central government. Cities are assigned with different industrial goals to achieve globally optimal economic success and a fast-growing economy. By dividing Chinese cities into two groups based on their administrative levels and premium resources allocated by the central government, we find that Chinese cities follow two distinct industrial development trajectories: one trajectory involves government support leading to a diversified industrial structure and, thus, a diversified job market, and in the other trajectory an absence of government support leads to specialty cities and, therefore, a specialized job market. By estimating the impact of automation on a polarized job market, we observe a Simpson's paradox: overall, there is not a statistically significant relationship between city size and resilience to automation, but when we disaggregate by the level of job diversity, we find larger citi\""

In healthy adults, aerobic exercise has been shown to induce transient effects on cognition after a single exercise session and persistent effects on cognition following regular exercise over the course of several months.[2][11][15] People who regularly perform an aerobic exercise (e.g., running, jogging, brisk walking, swimming, and cycling) have greater scores on neuropsychological function and performance tests that measure certain cognitive functions, such as attentional control, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, working memory updating and capacity, declarative memory, spatial memory, and information processing speed.[2][6][8][10][11][15][16][17][excessive citations] The transient effects of exercise on cognition include improvements in most executive functions (e.g., attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, problem solving, and decision making) and information processing speed for a period of up to 2\u00a0hours after exercising.[15]. Aerobic exercise induces short- and long-term effects on mood and emotional states by promoting positive affect, inhibiting negative affect, and decreasing the biological response to acute psychological stress.[15] Over the short-term, aerobic exercise functions as both an antidepressant and euphoriant,[18][19][20][21] whereas consistent exercise produces general improvements in mood and self-esteem.[22][23]. Regular aerobic exercise improves symptoms associated with a variety of central nervous system disorders and may be used as adjunct therapy for these disorders. There is clear evidence of exercise treatment efficacy for major depressive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.[12][20][24][25][26] The American Academy of Neurology's clinical practice guideline for mild cognitive impairment indicates that clinicians should recommend regular exercise (two times per week) to individuals who have been diagnosed with this condition.[27] Reviews of clinical evidence also support the use of exercise as an adjunct therapy for certain neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.[28][29][30][31][32][33] Regular exercise is also associated with a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders.[31][34] A large body of preclinical evidence and emerging clinical evidence supports the use of exercise as an adjunct therapy for the treatment and prevention of drug addictions.[35][36][37][38][39] Regular exercise has also been proposed as an adjunct therapy for brain cancers.[40].\""

Diversity can impact performance, team member satisfaction or the innovative capacity of a team. According to the Input-Process-Output Model, team diversity is considered an input factor that has effects on the processes as well as on the team outputs of team work.. During the 2010s, corporate firms began to focus on unlocking the value of this diversity through many HR / recruiting programs.. The demographic diversity of members of a team describes differences in observable attributes like gender, age or ethnicity.\""

Creative employees experiment with new ideas and concepts and thus contribute to the firms' success. Prior research has demonstrated that the diversity of team participants' knowledge, behavior, and values can promote creativity (Craig & Kelly, 1999; Kurtzberg, 2005; Milliken & Martins, 1996). Creativity through diversity can be amplified by team members' different national cultures as well. Such national cultural diversity also increases through improved market knowledge about the match between expectations and products delivered to customers of global markets. Thus, culturally diverse innovation teams are an option for coping with the challenge of globalizing markets. Despite these advantages of heterogeneity, however, firms are confronted with the negative consequences experienced in international teams whose members come from differing educational backgrounds. The diversity of national background can cause problems in interpersonal understanding and the work atmosphere\u2014precipitating excessive disagreement, for instance\u2014and can thereby adversely affect team moral and efficiency (Jehn et al., 1999), possibly dampening creativity.In short, it is important to under\""

Modifiable lifestyle factors that cause a decline in cardiometabolic health, such as physical inactivity, exacerbate these changes beyond those that are associated with normal ageing. The purpose of this review was to examine cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuroanatomical adaptations to ageing and the potential benefits of exercise training on these outcomes in adults 50\u2009years or older. We systematically searched for cross-sectional or intervention studies that included exercise (aerobic, resistance or multimodal) and its effect on cerebrovascular function, cognition and neuroanatomical adaptations in this age demographic. The included studies were tabulated and described narratively. Aerobic exercise training was the predominant focus of the studies identified; there were limited studies exploring the effects of resistance exercise training and multimodal training on cerebrovascular function and cognition. Collectively, the evidence indicated that exercise can improve cerebrovascular function, cognition and neuroplasticity through areas of the brain associated with executive function and memory in adults 50\u2009years or older, irrespective of their health status. However, more research is required to ascertain the mechanisms of action.\"},{\"Title\":\"The Effects of Virtual Kayak Paddling Exercise on Postural Balance, Muscle Performance, and Cognitive Function in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\",\"Abstract\":\"Deterioration of physical and psychological health is an important issue in older adults aged 65 years or more. This study aimed to determine whether a virtual kayak paddling (VKP) exercise could improve postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to the VKP (n\u2009=\u200930) or control group (n\u2009=\u200930). Participants in the VKP group performed the paddling exercise in a virtual environment for 60\u00a0min twice a week for 6 weeks, whereas those in the control group performed home exercises. Postural balance (p\u2009<\u2009.05), muscle performance (p\u2009<\u2009.05), and cognitive function (p\u2009<\u2009.05) were significantly improved in the VKP group and were superior to those in the control group (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Thus, the findings indicate that VKP exercise improves postural balance, muscle performance, and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.\"},{\"Title\":\"Exercise interventions for cognitive function in adults older than 50: a systematic review with meta-analysis\",\"Abstract\":\"Background Physical exercise is seen as a promising intervention to prevent or delay cognitive decline in individuals aged 50 years and older, yet the evidence from reviews is not conclusive.

                        "observation": "\"The neurobiological effects of physical exercise are numerous and involve a wide range of interrelated effects on brain structure,[1] brain function, and cognition.[2][3][4][5] A large body of research in humans has demonstrated that consistent aerobic exercise (e.g., 30\u00a0minutes every day) induces persistent improvements in certain cognitive functions, healthy alterations in gene expression in the brain, and beneficial forms of neuroplasticity and behavioral plasticity; some of these long-term effects include: increased neuron growth, increased neurological activity (e.g., c-Fos and BDNF signaling), improved stress coping, enhanced cognitive control of behavior, improved declarative, spatial, and working memory, and structural and functional improvements in brain structures and pathways associated with cognitive control and memory.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][excessive citations] The effects of exercise on cognition have important implications for improving academic performance in children and college students, improving adult productivity, preserving cognitive function in old age, preventing or treating certain neurological disorders, and improving overall quality of life.[2][12][13][14]. In healthy adults, aerobic exercise has been shown to induce transient effects on cognition after a single exercise session and persistent effects on cognition following regular exercise over the course of several months.[2][11][15] People who regularly perform an aerobic exercise (e.g., running, jogging, brisk walking, swimming, and cycling) have greater scores on neuropsychological function and performance tests that measure certain cognitive functions, such as attentional control, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, working memory updating and capacity, declarative memory, spatial memory, and information processing speed.[2][6][8][10][11][15][16][17][excessive citations] The transient effects of exercise on cognition include improvements in most executive functions (e.g., attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, problem solving, and decision making) and information processing speed for a period of up to 2\u00a0hours after exercising.[15]. Aerobic exercise induces short- and long-term effects on mood and emotional states by promoting positive affect, inhibiting negative affect, and decreasing the biological response to acute psychological stress.[15] Over the short-term, aerobic exercise functions as both an antidepressant and euphoriant,[18][19][20][21] whereas consistent exercise produces general improvements in mood and self-esteem.[22][23]. Regular aerobic exercise improves symptoms associated with a variety of central nervous system disorders and may be used as adjunct therapy for these disorders. There is clear evidence of exercise treatment efficacy for major depressive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.[12][20][24][25][26] The American Academy of Neurology's clinical practice guideline for mild cognitive impairment indicates that clinicians should recommend regular exercise (two times per week) to individuals who have been diagnosed with this condition.[27] Reviews of clinical evidence also support the use of exercise as an adjunct therapy for certain neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.[28][29][30][31][32][33] Regular exercise is also associated with a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders.[31][34] A large body of preclinical evidence and emerging clinical evidence supports the use of exercise as an adjunct therapy for the treatment and prevention of drug addictions.[35][36][37][38][39] Regular exercise has also been proposed as an adjunct therapy for brain cancers.[40].\""

Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).[3] Air pollution can be caused by both human activities[4] and natural phenomena.[5]. Air quality is closely related to the earth's climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.[2]. Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer.[6] [Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition,[7] increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression[8] and detrimental perinatal health.][9] The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system.\""

The term aerosol commonly refers to the particulate/air mixture, as opposed to the particulate matter alone.[1] Sources of particulate matter can be natural or anthropogenic.[2] They have impacts on climate and precipitation that adversely affect human health, in ways additional to direct inhalation.. Types of atmospheric particles include suspended particulate matter; thoracic and respirable particles;[3] inhalable coarse particles, designated PM10, which are coarse particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers (\u03bcm) or less; fine particles, designated PM2.5, with a diameter of 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm or less;[4] ultrafine particles, with a diameter of 100\u00a0nm or less; and soot.. The IARC and WHO designate airborne particulates as a Group 1 carcinogen.[5] Particulates are the most harmful form (other than ultra-fines) of air pollution[6] due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and brain from the blood streams, causing health problems including heart disease, lung disease, and premature death.[7] In 2013, a study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries revealed that there was no safe level of particulates and that for every increase of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 in PM10, the lung cancer rate rose 22% (95% CI [1.03\u20131.45]). The smaller PM2.5, which can penetrate deeper into the lungs, were associated with an 18% increase in lung cancer per 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m3; however, this study did not show statistical significance for this association (95% CI [0.96\u20131.46])[8] Worldwide exposure to PM2.5 contributed to 4.1 million deaths from heart disease and stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections in 2016.[9] Overall, ambient particulate matter ranks as the sixth leading risk factor for premature death globally.[10].\""

Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).[3] Air pollution can be caused by both human activities[4] and natural phenomena.[5]. Air quality is closely related to the earth's climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.[2]. Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer.[6] [Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition,[7] increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression[8] and detrimental perinatal health.][9] The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system.\""

Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in European harmony and African rhythmic rituals.[5][6]. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles.

Davidson,[17][18] and Sam Harris.. Clinical psychology and psychiatry since the 1970s have developed a number of therapeutic applications based on mindfulness for helping people experiencing a variety of psychological conditions.[18] Mindfulness practice has been employed to reduce depression,[19][20][21][22] stress,[20][23][24] anxiety,[19][20][25] and in the treatment of drug addiction.[26][27][28] Programs based on mindfulness models have been adopted within schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans' centers, and other environments, and mindfulness programs have been applied for additional outcomes such as for healthy aging, weight management, athletic performance,[29] helping children with special needs, and as an intervention during the perinatal period.. Clinical studies have documented both physical- and mental-health benefits of mindfulness in different patient categories as well as in healthy adults and children.[3][30][31] Studies have shown a positive relationship between trait mindfulness (which can be cultivated through the practice of mindfulness-based interventions) and psychological health.[32][33] The practice of mindfulness appears to provide therapeutic benefits to people with psychiatric disorders,[34][35][36] including moderate benefits to those with psychosis.[37][38][39] Studies also indicate that rumination and worry contribute to a variety of mental disorders,[40][41][42] and that mindfulness-based interventions can enhance trait mindfulness[43] and reduce both rumination and worry.[42][44][45] Further, the practice of mindfulness may be a preventive strategy to halt the development of mental-health problems.[46][47]  However, according to one opinion article, too much mindfulness may produce negative effects.[48]. Evidence suggests that engaging in mindfulness meditation may influence physical health.[49] For example, the psychological habit of repeatedly dwelling on stressful thoughts appears to intensify the physiological effects of the stressor (as a result of the continual activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis) with the potential to lead to physical health related clinical manifestations.[50][51][52] Studies indicate that mindfulness meditation, which brings about reductions in rumination, may alter these biological clinical pathways.[50][42][53] Further, research indicates that mindfulness may favorably influence the immune system[54] as well as inflammation,[3][55][56] which can consequently impact physical health, especially considering that inflammation has been linked to the development of several chronic health conditions.[57][58] Other studies support these findings.[59][60][53] Additionally, mindfulness appears to bring about lowered activity of the default mode network of the brain, and thereby contribute towards a lowered risk of developing conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease.[50].\""

The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood.[12] There are many environmental and genetic risk factors associated with its development. The strongest genetic risk factor is from an allele of APOE.[15][16] Other risk factors include a history of head injury, clinical depression, and high blood pressure.[1] The disease process is largely associated with amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neuronal connections in the brain.[13] A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes.[5] Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal brain aging.[12] Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis, but this can only take place after death.[13] Good nutrition, physical activity, and engaging socially are known to be of benefit generally in aging, and these may help in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's; in 2019 clinical trials were underway to look at these possibilities.[13] There are no medications or supplements that have been shown to decrease risk.[17]. No treatments stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms.[2] Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing a burden on the caregiver.[18] The pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements.[18] Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes.[19] Behavioral problems or psychosis due to dementia are often treated with antipsychotics, but this is not usually recommended, as there is little benefit and an increased risk of early death.[20][21]. As of 2020, there were approximately 50 million people worldwide with Alzheimer's disease.[10] It most often begins in people over 65\u00a0years of age, although up to 10% of cases are early-onset affecting those in their 30s to mid-60s.[13][4] It affects about 6% of people 65 years and older,[12] and women more often than men.[22] The disease is named after German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer, who first described it in 1906.[23] Alzheimer's financial burden on society is large, with an estimated global annual cost of US$1\u00a0trillion.[10] Alzheimer's disease is currently ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.[24].\""

First performed in bars, jazz can now be heard in clubs, concert halls, universities, and large festivals all over the world.New Orleans, Louisiana, around the turn of the 20th century was a melting pot of cultures.

European classical music, American blues, and South American songs and rhythms came together to form what became known as jazz. The origin of the word jazz is widely disputed, although it is thought to have originally been a sexual term.One thing that distinguishes jazz music is its focus on improvisation. Louis Armstrong, a trumpet player from New Orleans and then Chicago, is considered the father of modern jazz improvisation. His trumpet solos were melodic and playful and filled with energy that could only result from being composed on the spot. A leader of several groups in the 1920s and 30s, Armstrong inspired countless others to make the music their own by developing a personal style of improvisation.Thanks to early records, \""

With rapid temperature swings around the world, ecosystems have been thrown into flux, exacerbating problems such as habitat loss that have already pushed many plant and animal species to the brink. Some biologists argue that Earth is on the verge of another major extinction event. The big question is whether plants and animals can adapt quickly enough to outpace climate change.We often think of evolution as something that happens slowly, but that\u2019s not always the case. If the selection pressures are strong enough, evolution can happen over mere decades. For instance, an experiment growing brewer\u2019s yeast in environments with deadly concentrations of salt showed that the microbe population took a hit but then bounced back thanks to rapid changes in a couple genes over just 25 generations.Identifying\u00a0genetic adaptations in response to climate change can be tricky. Long-term data sets can tell us the most about whether a species is truly evolving, but it\u2019s hard to tell if any genetic differences were selected for climate reasons alone. What's more, not all genetic adaptations may be beneficial in the long term. And some species may not even need to evolve to survive.\u00a0Physical or behavioral modifications made during an individual's life\""

This was 55% higher growth than that achieved in 2020 and was the highest among all renewable power technologies. Such rapid development was possible thanks to an unprecedented increase in wind capacity additions, which reached 113\u202fGW in 2020, compared with just 59\u202fGW in 2019. However, to get on track with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which has approximately 7\u202f900\u202fTWh of wind electricity generation in 2030, it is necessary to raise average annual capacity additions to almost 250\u202fGW, more than double 2020\u2019s record growth. Much greater efforts are needed to achieve this level of sustained capacity growth, with the most important areas for improvement being facilitating permitting for onshore wind and cost reductions for offshore wind.The amount of electricity generated by wind increased by almost 273\u202fTWh in 2021 (up 17%), 55% higher growth than that achieved in 2020 and the largest of all power generation technologies.

Individuals living with others with poor mental health are significantly more likely to report worse mental health themselves. The size of the coefficients and their significance are comparable across the five countries. In contrast to previous studies, the relationship between higher education and better mental health is weak or non-existent. Fur\""

Two strategies designed to improve recall when the net is partially connected or the input cues are noisy are shown to provide significantly greater capacity and information efficiency under these conditions. Estimates are made for the capacity of nets that are the size of the CA3 region of the rat hippocampus. These indicate that thousands of patterns can be stored, with the exact number highly dependent on pattern coding rates and the recall strategy. Analysis of nets with different types of structure shows that the capacity is much more sensitive to net size than to connectivity level. This has implications for neurobiology where there are examples of environmentally produced changes in both the size and connectivity of various brain regions.\"},{\"Title\":\"Contributions of glucocorticoid receptors in cortical astrocytes to memory recall\",\"Abstract\":\"Dysfunctions in memory recall lead to pathological fear; a hallmark of trauma-related disorders, like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Both, heightened recall of an association between a cue and trauma, as well as impoverished recall that a previously trauma-related cue is no longer a threat, result in a debilitating fear toward the cue. Glucocorticoid-mediated action via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) influences memory recall. This literature has primarily focused on GRs expressed in neurons or ignored cell-type specific contributions. To ask how GR action in nonneuronal cells influences memory recall, we combined auditory fear conditioning in mice and the knockout of GRs in astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region implicated in memory recall. We found that knocking out GRs in astrocytes of the PFC disrupted memory recall. Specifically, we found that knocking out GRs in astrocytes in the PFC (AstroGRKO) after fear conditioning resulted in higher levels of freezing to the CS+ tone when compared with controls (AstroGRintact). While we did not find any differences in extinction of fear toward the CS+ between these groups, AstroGRKO female but not male mice showed impaired recall of extinction training. These results suggest that GRs in cortical astrocytes contribute to memory recall. These data demonstrate the need to examine GR action in cortical astrocytes to elucidate the basic neurobiology underlying memory recall and potential mechanisms that underlie female-specific biases in the incidence of PTSD.\"},{\"Title\":\"Sex-specific calibration of memory recall by glucocorticoid receptors on cortical astrocytes\",\"Abstract\":\"Dysfunctions in memory recall lead to pathological fear; a hallmark of trauma-related disorders, like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

The impact of social media on political campaigns is undeniable and has been a hot topic of discussion in recent years. Social media have influenced political campaigns, including its effects on voter behavior, political communication, and campaign strategy.There is also a role of social media in shaping the political discourse, spreading misinformation, and amplifying political polarization. It is important to recognize the power and influence of social media in shaping our political landscape. While social media has the potential to connect politicians with voters and promote democratic participation, it also raises significant concerns about the role of technology in politics. Ultimately, the impact of social media on political campaigns will continue to evolve as new platforms emerge and as society grapples with the implications of digital technology on our political institutions.According to the latest data from Datareportal\u2019s January 2023 global overview, the growth of social media has continued to rise, with over half of the world\u2019s population (59%) now using social media.

Climate change is a critical yet underappreciated amplifier of human\u2013wildlife conflict, as it exacerbates resource scarcity, alters human and animal behaviours and distributions, and increases human\u2013wildlife encounters. We synthesize evidence of climate-driven conflicts occurring among ten taxonomic orders, on six continents and in all five oceans. Such conflicts disrupt both subsistence livelihoods and industrial economies and may accelerate the rate at which human\u2013wildlife conflict drives wildlife declines. We introduce a framework describing distinct environmental, ecological and sociopolitical pathways through which climate variability and change percolate via complex social\u2013ecological systems to influence patterns and outcomes of human\u2013wildlife interactions.

Interpersonal communication research addresses at least six categories of inquiry: 1) how humans adjust and adapt their verbal communication and nonverbal communication during face-to-face communication; 2) how messages are produced; 3) how uncertainty influences behavior and information-management strategies; 4) deceptive communication; 5) relational dialectics; and 6) social interactions that are mediated by technology.[2]. A large number of scholars have described their work as research into interpersonal communication. There is considerable variety in how this area of study is conceptually and operationally defined.[3] Researchers in interpersonal communication come from many different research paradigms and theoretical traditions, adding to the complexity of the field.[4][5] Interpersonal communication is often defined as communication that takes place between people who are interdependent and have some knowledge of each other: for example, communication between a son and his father, an employer and an employee, two sisters, a teacher and a student, two lovers, two friends, and so on.. Although interpersonal communication is most often between pairs of individuals, it can also be extended to include small intimate groups such as the family.\""

It is based on a simplified version of the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 antiviral defense system. By delivering the Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added in vivo.[1]. The technique is considered highly significant in biotechnology and medicine as it enables editing genomes in vivo very precisely, cheaply, and easily. It can be used in the creation of new medicines, agricultural products, and genetically modified organisms, or as a means of controlling pathogens and pests.\""

The term social in regard to media suggests that platforms are user-centric and enable communal activity. As such, social media can be viewed as online facilitators or enhancers of human networks\u2014webs of individuals who enhance social connectivity.[7].

Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source.

Surfactant/polymer (SP) coreflood experiments were conducted under the same conditions for comparison. NaOH has been used for ASP floods of sandstones, but these are the first experiments to test it for ASP floods of limestones. Two studies performed under different reservoir conditions showed that NaOH significantly reduced the surfactant retention in Indiana Limestone. An ASP solution with 0.3 wt% NaOH has a pH of approximately 12.6 at 25\u00b0C. The high pH increases the negative surface charge of the carbonate, which favors lower adsorption of anionic surfactants. Another advantage of NaOH is that low concentrations of only approximately 0.3 wt% can be used because of its low molecular weight and its low consumption in limestones. Most reservoir carbonates contain gypsum or anhydrite, and therefore sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) will be consumed by the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). As shown in the two studies, NaOH can be used in limestone reservoirs containing gypsum or anhydrite.\"}]}"

The terms Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire were coined in modern times to describe political entities that were de facto independent; contemporary Romans did not consider the Empire to have been split into two empires but viewed it as a single polity governed by two imperial courts as an administrative expediency. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476, and the Western imperial court in Ravenna was formally dissolved by Justinian in 554. The Eastern imperial court lasted until 1453.. Though the Empire had seen periods with more than one emperor ruling jointly before, the view that it was impossible for a single emperor to govern the entire Empire was institutionalised with reforms to Roman law by emperor Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegrations of the Crisis of the Third Century.\""

There are two main ways of exploiting these sources. In the first a back-up supply is provided. Thus, with solar water heating, it is customary to rely on electrical immersion heaters or boilers burning gas, oil or solid fuel to supplement the solar energy input during the winter months and at other times when the insolation level is low. It is generally accepted that large wind generators would feed their electrical output into the national grid. On windy days the output would reduce the amount of electricity generated in conventional power stations, thereby saving fuel. The installation of a wind or solar power plant by itself, however, will save little, if any, conventional generating capacity, as there can be no guarantee of significant wind or solar generation at times of peak demand. The second way of exploiting renewable energy sources is to couple them wi\""

In recent years, studies of meditation have increasingly involved the use of modern instruments, such as fMRI and EEG, which are able to observe brain physiology and neural activity in living subjects, either during the act of meditation itself or before and after meditation. Correlations can thus be established between meditative practices and brain structure or function.[1]. Since the 1950s hundreds of studies on meditation have been conducted, but many of the early studies were flawed and thus yielded unreliable results.[2][3] Contemporary studies have attempted to address many of these flaws with the hope of guiding current research into a more fruitful path.[4] In 2013, researchers found moderate evidence that meditation can reduce anxiety, depression, and pain, but no evidence that it is more effective than active treatments such as drugs or exercise.[5] Another major review article also cautioned about possible misinformation and misinterpretation of data related to the subject.[6][7]. A previous study commissioned by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that meditation interventions reduce multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress.[5] Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that mindfulness meditation has several mental health benefits such as bringing about reductions in depression symptoms,[8][9][10] improvements in mood,[11] stress-resilience[11] and attentional control.[11] Mindfulness interventions also appear to be a promising intervention for managing depression in youth.[12][13].\""

Typically used for texts, the invention and global spread of the printing press was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.[1][2]. In Germany, around 1440, goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press, which started the Printing Revolution. Modelled on the design of existing screw presses, a single Renaissance movable-type printing press could produce up to 3,600 pages per workday,[3] compared to forty by hand-printing and a few by hand-copying.[4] Gutenberg's newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities.\""

Other early forms include block seals, hammered coinage, pottery imprints, and cloth printing. Initially a method of printing patterns on cloth such as silk, woodblock printing for texts on paper originated in China by the 7th century during the Tang dynasty, leading to the spread of book production and woodblock printing in other parts of Asia such as Korea and Japan. The Chinese Buddhist Diamond Sutra, printed by woodblock on 11 May 868, is the earliest known printed book with a precise publishing date. Movable type was invented by Chinese artisan Bi Sheng in the 11th century during the Song dynasty, but it received limited use compared to woodblock printing.\""

In 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, and nearly twenty years later the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.[4] Both these institutions supported the growth and implementation of MBSR into hospitals worldwide.[1] Kabat-Zinn described the MBSR program in detail in his bestselling 1990 book Full Catastrophe Living, which was reissued in a revised edition in 2013.[1] In 1993, the MBSR course taught by Jon Kabat-Zinn was featured in Bill Moyer's Healing from Within.[14] In the year 2015, close to 80% of medical schools are reported[15] to offer some element of mindfulness training, and research and education centers dedicated to mindfulness have proliferated.. A meta-analysis described MBSR as \\\"a group program that focuses upon the progressive acquisition of mindful awareness, of mindfulness\\\".[16] The MBSR program is an eight-week workshop taught by certified trainers that entails weekly group meetings (2.5 hour classes) and a one-day retreat (seven-hour mindfulness practice) between sessions six and seven, homework (45 minutes daily), and instruction in three formal techniques: mindfulness meditation, body scanning and simple yoga postures.[1] Group discussions and exploration - of experience of the meditation practice and its application to life - is a central part of the program. Body scanning is the first prolonged formal mindfulness technique taught during the first four weeks of the course, and entails quietly sitting or lying  and systematically focusing one's attention on various regions of the body, starting with the toes and moving up slowly to the top of the head.[1][4]. MBSR is based on non-judging, non-striving, acceptance, letting go, beginners mind, patience, trust, and non-centering.[17][1].\""

Here, the authors show that wildfire reduced peatland carbon uptake and enhanced emissions from degraded peatlands; climate change impacts accelerated carbon losses where increased burn rate and severity reduced carbon sink.Atmospheric methane concentrations are increasing and a process-based model now estimates greater methane emissions from wetlands since 2007 than previous studies. Substantial increases in 2020 and 2021 contributed to record-high growth rates in the atmospheric methane burden.Loss and damage funds are intended to support low-income regions experiencing impacts of human-caused climate change.

Adaptation strategies will require a robust understanding of the risks to species and ecosystems and how those propagate to human societies. We develop a unified and spatially explicit index to comprehensively evaluate the climate risks to marine life. Under high emissions (SSP5-8.5), almost 90% of ~25,000 species are at high or critical risk, with species at risk across 85% of their native distributions. One tenth of the ocean contains ecosystems where the aggregated climate risk, endemism and extinction threat of their constituent species are high. Climate change poses the greatest risk for exploited species in low-income countries with a high dependence on fisheries. Mitigating emissions (SSP1-2.6) reduces the risk for virtually all species (98.2%), enhances ecosystem stability and disproportionately benefits food-insecure populations in low-income countries.

In 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, and nearly twenty years later the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.[4] Both these institutions supported the growth and implementation of MBSR into hospitals worldwide.[1] Kabat-Zinn described the MBSR program in detail in his bestselling 1990 book Full Catastrophe Living, which was reissued in a revised edition in 2013.[1] In 1993, the MBSR course taught by Jon Kabat-Zinn was featured in Bill Moyer's Healing from Within.[14] In the year 2015, close to 80% of medical schools are reported[15] to offer some element of mindfulness training, and research and education centers dedicated to mindfulness have proliferated.. A meta-analysis described MBSR as \\\"a group program that focuses upon the progressive acquisition of mindful awareness, of mindfulness\\\".[16] The MBSR program is an eight-week workshop taught by certified trainers that entails weekly group meetings (2.5 hour classes) and a one-day retreat (seven-hour mindfulness practice) between sessions six and seven, homework (45 minutes daily), and instruction in three formal techniques: mindfulness meditation, body scanning and simple yoga postures.[1] Group discussions and exploration - of experience of the meditation practice and its application to life - is a central part of the program. Body scanning is the first prolonged formal mindfulness technique taught during the first four weeks of the course, and entails quietly sitting or lying  and systematically focusing one's attention on various regions of the body, starting with the toes and moving up slowly to the top of the head.[1][4]. MBSR is based on non-judging, non-striving, acceptance, letting go, beginners mind, patience, trust, and non-centering.[17][1].\""
